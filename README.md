# Meals Made Easy Backend API

## Documentation
All documentation of the APIs provided by this application are available [on the wiki of this repo](https://github.com/MealsMadeEasy/Backend/wiki). This is broken down by endpoint, and also contains information about API changes over time.

## Setup
Before you begin, note that this server is hosted on Heroku at `https://meals-made-easy.herokuapp.com/`. You only need to follow these steps if you want to run the server on your own machine.

### Prerequisites
 - You must have version 1.8 or higher of the [Java runtime (JRE)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) and the [Java development kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
 - Before running the server, you'll need access to a [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/) project's Admin account credentials, a [Mercury](https://mercury.postlight.com/web-parser/) API key, and an [Edamam](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) API key.
    - If you want to create a new Firebase project, you can obtain these values by navigating to [Service Accounts](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk?authuser=0). Then click "Generate New Private Key" at the bottom of the "Firebase Admin SDK" to generate a new key, which you'll use in the installation step.
    - To get an API key for other platforms, follow the registration steps on the corresponding website to get started.
    - **Note:** It's very important to keep these values private to prevent attackers from abusing the system.

### Dependencies
 - All dependencies are managed automatically with Gradle, which is included in this repo.

### Download
 - All code for the backend server exists in this repository. To download it, you can clone this repository, or [save it as a ZIP](https://github.com/MealsMadeEasy/Backend/archive/master.zip).
 - Save or extract this repo where you can conveniently access it, such as `Downloads/Backend/`.

### Build
 - This project uses Gradle as its build system through the Gradle Wrapper.
 - To build the application, run `gradlew jar` in a terminal from the root of the repository
   - On Windows, open the start menu, type `cmd`, and hit enter. On MacOS, open Spotlight by pressing `âŒ˜ + space`, type `Terminal` into the search box, and hit return.
   - Open the folder where you cloned/extracted this repository in the terminal by typing `cd Downloads/Backend` and then pressing enter (Replace `Downloads/Backend` with wherever the repository is located).
   - On Windows, type `gradlew jar` and press enter. On MacOS, type `./gradlew jar` and press return.
   - Gradle will build the application and create a file in `build/libs/mealsmadeeasy-1.0.jar`.

### Installation
 - The server will read these private keys through environment variables. Learn [how to create custom environment variables](https://www.schrodinger.com/kb/1842), and add the following values:

| Key                        | Notes                                                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EDAMAM_APP_ID`            | 8 characters                                                                                   |
| `EDAMAM_APP_KEY`           | 32 characters                                                                                  |
| `MERCURY_API_KEY`          | ~40 characters                                                                                 |
| `MME_CLIENT_EMAIL`         | From Firebase; e.g. `firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx@mealsmadeeasy-xxxxx.gserviceaccount.com`          |
| `MME_CLIENT_ID`            | From Firebase; ~20 digits                                                                      |
| `MME_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL` | From Firebase; e.g. `https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/firebase-adminsdk-...`  |
| `MME_PRIVATE_KEY`          | From Firebase; starts with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`                                       |
| `MME_PRIVATE_KEY_ID`       | From Firebase; ~40 characters                                                                  |

### Running the Server
 - Once you've got the application built and your environment variables setup, you're ready to run the project.
 - Using similar steps from before, open a terminal and navigate to the repository.
 - Navigate to the build folder by typing `cd build/libs/` and press enter.
 - Launch the application by typing `java -jar mealsmadeeasy-1.0.jar`.
 - The server will start on port 80 and will fulfill any requests sent to the host.
 - To stop the server, press `ctrl + C` on Windows or `control + C` on MacOS.
 
 ### Common Issues
  - When running the server, if you receive an error stating "Address already in use," then there is another application running on port 80. Stop all other applications that may be using that port, including instances of the server that may be running in the background. Rebooting the computer should stop any such applications. Once there are no applications running on the port, you can restart the server.
  - If the server returns 500 errors for requests that lookup meals, verify that the Edamam API key and appId are correctly specified in environment variables.
  - If the server displays a warning about missing Firebase credentials, verify that the Firebase API keys have been correctly specified in environment variables. Additionally, ensure that the keys are valid and have not been revoked on the Firebase Dashboard.

## Known Issues
Due to time constraints and limited resources, there were a few minor bugs that were left unresolved in the final release. These particularly relate to the grocery list:
 - Suggested meals do not take user preferences or habits into consideration. This was not implemented due to time constraints, but could be done retroactively as meal plan selections are saved indefinitely.
 - All units in the grocery list are in grams. With a subscription to Edamam, it would be possible to use more relevant units, which is a limitation of our free Edamam API key.
 - The grocery list does not combine similar ingredients. For example, if one ingredient calls for `minced garlic cloves` and another calls for `garlic cloves`, the ingredients will not be combined. This is a side effect of how ingredient names are processed, and may be resolved with an Edamam subscription.
 - Similarly, the grocery list may contain extraneous or irrelevant information. For example, a recipe on Edamam may list one of the ingredients as `salt and pepper to taste`. Although this ingredient is immeasurable and could be omitted or simply expressed as `salt and pepper`, the server is not smart enough to make either adjustment.
